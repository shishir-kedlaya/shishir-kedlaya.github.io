        Oh, ow! Where'd you get the coconuts? Now, look here, my good man. Be quiet! A newt? Well, I got better.
        Well, we did do the nose. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Well, I didn't vote for you.
        He hasn't got shit all over him. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!.

        Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.
        Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
        I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction!
        Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

      <p>
        We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
